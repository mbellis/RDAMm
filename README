* RDAM is the acronym of **Rank Difference Analysis of Microarrays**.
|
* Microarrays are devices which allow to measure simultaneously the expression level
 of thousands of genes in a particular biological condition. If several samples of 
 the same biological conditions are at disposal, we speak of *replicates*.
  
* RDAM is intended to find genes that have a *statistically significant difference of*
 *expression level* when we compare replicates of two different biological conditions,
 e.g. four different *cancerous* liver biopsies versus three different *healthy* liver biopsies.|
|
* RDAM can be applied in other situations where the same type of measure is applied to
 huge replicated series of different items observed in two different conditions
 (**multiple paired tests with replicates**).

**RDAM uses a non-parametric approach**

* Measured values are first **ranked** onto a 0-100 range scale.

  * this allows to normalise all the replicates to a common scale,
 
  * in graphical representation each interval, or bin, contains the same number of items.
 
* Variation is expressed as a **rank difference**, and a geometrical transformation of
 the plot of rank difference versus rank allows to derive a *normalised  variation* called *zVar*.
  
  * this geometrical transformation applied to *two replicates of the same condition* gives the 
   *null distribution of zVar* **common to all the items**,

  * from the null distribution, we are able to estimate, for each item, 
   a p-value for each observed variation in all (or a subset of all)
   possible pairs of replicates between the two conditions,

  * for each item, the different Zvar and their associated p-values are 
   combined in order to calculate a single Zvar and p-value that sum up 
   the variation of that item between the two conditions.

* Multiple testing is taken in account, and **false discovery rate (Fdr)** and
 **sensitivity** are estimated in order to make adapted selection of items.
  
  * Fdr is the percentage of false positives in the final selection,

  * Sensitivity is the percentage of really varying items that are present in the final selection.
   Knowledge of these two statistics allows the user to select the most convenient compromise    between *specificity* and *sensitivity*
